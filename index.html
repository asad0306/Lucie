    <h1>Qais-Lucie - Relationship.</h1>
    <p class="line-1">I know you start loving me since 2018 when I was in Douala we met in the office so many 
        times and we had training for sage software that time also we spend time much in the office
         and I start noticing you like whenever I used to come to the office after I entre the 
         office you saw me and you start behaving panic and trying to escape from that office 
         anyhow like you can’t stand with me you’re like what do I do till the time this man 
         don’t go back. Very rare you saw in my eyes those time seriously I saw you’re having 
         feelings for me so much and somehow strong enough but frankly speaking that time I was 
         not that much into you the way you have feeling for me I was just like you or some small
          feeling that’s it not something more than that.</p>
          <p class="line-2">
            I start loving you in the month of September-2019 when I fall sick first time in Cameroon 
            after that I don’t know I started feeling so much for you love and all but was not sure 
            about you because each and every time I was having in the mind that she is married having
             family children nothing can happen between us so don’t force ourselves for this I like 
             I can love you we can spend time together but can’t be together in future by the time 
             passing I started attaching you flame was stated to raising and after when I met you 
             first I in that hotel in Douala after that I went to holiday I didn’t contact you truth 
             speaking I thought about you some time but I was be in my mind to call you message you 
             or something else at the time of leaving India I was busying thing  for me for Ali and 
             Naresh that time I thought of you to buy something for you but I was having very less
              time so I won’t be able to take good stuff I was buying perfume for me so I buy 2 bottles 
              for you also without even thinking that you’re going to like it or not I just took
            I was not even knowing that how I’m going to give that perfume.
          </p>
          <p class="line-3">
            Finally, I reach Douala after calling Ali I message you because somehow I was knowing 
            that maybe you’re waiting for you because the way you’re asking me before I leave 
            Cameroon for India that you’re going to come or not I feel something about me
             in your heart seriously after one day I left for Garoua without seeing you 
             even you called me to meet it was late so I refuse due to Arkays night roaming issues.
          </p>
          <p class="line-4">
            After coming Garoua after some day’s we start talking each and every time like before I 
            never used to give you reply on time but after coming from India I started taking you 
            serious small and when you say me that you’re planning to come to me Garoua I was like 
            really is she really want to come or just saying but you came I fall sick we had time 
            together but due to my health status we couldn’t enjoy that moment after you left I was 
            angry on you because you force me to have sex with you it’s okay  I was with you but I 
            don’t wanted to talk to you for few day’s and suddenly you gave me news that you’re 
            pregnant I was happy like too much like mad you can’t even imagine but after so many 
            discussion fight and arguments we reach the point that you have to drop the child anyhow
             and I was like hate you Lucie that time also I was afraid to lose you so I just stop 
             taking to you but I don’t wanted to lose you.
          </p>
          <p class="line-5">
            I saw your effort towards me towards our relationship which I used to take as an granted
             in the staring days then again you put a lot effort to come to me in December-2020 I 
             was so happy just you came for less days but I was so happy to see you that a woman a 
             married woman taking so much risk just to come and see me to give me her love she has 
             a rick for road, transport, family, etc. but she decided to come all over so long journey
              I was like she has made a very special place in my heart and I will not give that place 
              to anyone in this world she will be there forever my love for you hit so hard from that 
              moment. The day you went back to Douala I was with you at agency when you go back and 
              seat in the bus I was like crying from inside I was like please don’t go please stay, 
              please stop don’t do this to me like this so much hard feeling seriously from that 
              moment I made a decision if you’re agree I would really like to get marry with you 
              to spend my whole life with you to live a very happy life and to give you the
               love you’re waiting for your whole life the love you’re missing for since the 
               love you’re looking in me the care you’re searching for the partner you’re looking for.
